Here we are using deep leraning model for training and prediction with the combination of  ensebmle learning concept and we have trained 4 model and if we use 3 model for prediction then it's providing us 71% precision and 51% accuracy and if we use 4 model combination then we are getting 61% of accuracy but our main goal is to find as many positive patient as possible which is nothing but true positive indicated by precision so if we are able incerease precision then it can find the positive patient.
The data set that we have use can be found here:https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset?files=1
